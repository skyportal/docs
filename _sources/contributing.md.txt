# How to Contribute

SkyPortal is released under the Modified BSD license, which means that
you are allowed to modify the code for your own purposes, as long as
you retain
our
[copyright notice](https://github.com/skyportal/skyportal/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

However, we would love to grow the SkyPortal community, and integrate
improvements directly into
our
[code repository on GitHub](https://github.com/skyportal/skyportal).

To make a contribution to the project:

1. Clone the SkyPortal repository
2. Make the changes you wish to submit on a new branch
3. Submit a pull request on GitHub.

The other developers will provide feedback, and you may push updates
into the same branch (which will also update your pull request), until
general consensus is achieved.
